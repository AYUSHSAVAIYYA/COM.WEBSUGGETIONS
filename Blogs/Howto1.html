<p> Pluralsight is offering 33% off discount for the month of July on Annual and Personal Premium subscriptions for a limited time ‚Äî valid through July 14th‚Äì16th.
Learning these days is no more difficult than used to be since the introduction of the internet. Everything you ever wanted to learn is just there, the only thing is you need is to know where to look efficiently.
Lynda (LinkedIn Learning), Udemy, Skillshare, Coursera, edx, and w3schools are some of the mainstream platforms to learn online.
But wait, there is one another popular platform, founded in 2004, called Pluralsight that focuses on being the best technology skills platform.

Pluralsight has more than 1500 expert authors that regularly update the contents on the platform.
It costs $29/month for Personal monthly subscription, $299/year for Personal annual subscription and $449/year for Premium plan. 
If pricing sounds expensive, however, given the learning resources Pluralsight provides, this pricing is justifiable.
Even more so, guys at Pluralsight are really generous as they have numerous offers and benefits going on for the users such as free 10 days trial, or 3 months / 6 months / a year of free access to Pluralsight paid subscription plans.
And exactly this is what we‚Äôll be discussing; 
all the possible ways to get Pluralsight benefits for free in 2019 / 2020. </p>
<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Trial and Referral Program: How to get a free Pluralsight Premium trial?
Unlike most of the other learning platforms (LinkedIn provides a 1-month free trial, Skillshare comes with 2 months free trial), Pluralsight provides only 10 days or 200 minutes of viewing the free trial.
You can activate the Pluralsight free trial by following steps below:</p>
<p>Step 1: Visit Pluralsight and click on ‚ÄúStart A Free 10-Day Trial‚Äù or click below üëá
Pluralsight - Unlimited Online Developer, IT, and Cyber Security Training
The technology skills platform that provides web development, IT certification and on-demand training that helps you.

Step 2: Select ‚ÄúStart My Free 10-Day Trial‚Äù under either monthly, annual or premium subscription.
Step 3: In the next page, fill up a form with your account details and proceed to ‚ÄúPayment‚Äù
Step 4: Enter your payment details (Credit/Debit card) and click ‚ÄúStart Free Trial‚Äù to activate your 10 days free trial. You will have full access to Pluralsight premium courses.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt want to continue the Pluralsight premium plan trial, you will have to cancel the trial before it ends so that the subscription doesn‚Äôt auto-renew itself. However, even after you cancel the trial and stay as a free Pluralsight user, you will still get to enjoy the perks for being a user. Pluralsight offers five free weekly courses, these free courses are uploaded each Tuesday and you can access from your Pluralsight homepage.

Other than a free trial, you can also enjoy the Pluralsight premium with a referral program. If you refer someone to Pluralsight and signs up for a non-Premium Personal annual or Personal monthly subscription using your referral link, you‚Äôll be rewarded a $20 Gift Card via email. This gift card can be used to buy a personal monthly subscription plan. However, you can only receive up to 12 gift cards (worth $240) from your successful referrals, which will provide you 8 months of Pluralsight monthly subscription.

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Via Pluralsight Partners:
Pluralsight in partnerships with multiple companies offers benefits such as free access to Pluralsight paid plan up to 3 months, 6 months or even for a year. And the best thing is to activate these benefits,
you won‚Äôt be required to enter your credit card details.
And to mention a few, we have listed on how to get Pluralsight free courses and plans if you are a user of Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio, or a Microsoft MVP, Microsoft RD, or a VMware Expert.
‚¶ø Pluralsight Partnerships: Visual Studio
Just a few months back, Pluralsight, in partnership with Visual Studio, was giving away 6 months of free access to Pluralsight Premium to Visual Studio free users, which then reduced to 3 months, later 1 month and finally canceled the benefit.
However, Pluralsight still offers six months and three months of free access to Visual Studio users, but there‚Äôs a catch; the Visual Studio user has to have an annual paid plan of Visual Studio. Nevertheless,
the free subscription to Pluralsight is a win, and to enable the benefit, follow the steps mentioned below.
Pluralsight free 3 months 6 months courses access using Visual Studio Benefit
How to get 6 months and 3 months of Pluralsight Premium free subscription in 2019 /2020?
Step 1: Sign up for the Pluralsight account or login if you already have one.
Step 2: Login to your Visual Studio account.
Step 3: Visit my.visualstudio.com or http://aka.ms/mymsdnbenefits and select the Pluralsight benefit.
Step 4: On the next page, fill up a Pluralsight form (make sure you use email address tied to your Pluralsight account) to activate the Pluralsight benefit.
Step 5: Now depending on your Visual Studio subscription, you will be offered either 6 months or 3 months of free access to Pluralsight Premium.
6 months of free Pluralsight Premium access: If you are a Visual Studio Enterprise user.
3 months of free Pluralsight Premium access: If you are Visual Studio Professional user, or MSDN Platforms user, or Visual Studio Test Professional user.
Good thing is, this benefit is a renewal or eligible for multiple times redeemable, however, you can only redeem once during the Visual Studio subscription period.</p>
For example, if you have subscribed to a two-year Visual Studio subscription, you can redeem the six-month benefit (or three-month benefit) now. And you can redeem it in another next two years when your next two-year subscription period begins.
